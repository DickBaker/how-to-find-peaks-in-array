Dr Jamro also has his own [website,](https://marcin.com/) and one of the article tips [operating on input array of integers] is
[HOW TO FIND PEAKS IN ARRAY?](https://marcin.com/how-to-find-peaks-in-array)

although the code presented produces the correct result for the **single** input set given, it produces spurious results on many others
hence this public repo to demonstrate such adverse behaviour [with NUnit tests], and to present an alternative implementation that passes the tests.
